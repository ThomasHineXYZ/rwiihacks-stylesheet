# r/WiiHacks Stylesheet

You'll need to install SASS to make changes and update the theme

Grab the theme from the CSS folder. If you make any edits, make sure you're running the `sasswatch` command from below, otherwise the `.css` file won't update.

# `sasswatch` command:
```
sass --watch scss:css --style compressed
```
